      "bio": "Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film.\r\n\r\nHe began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, which was funded by money from the sale of his script True Romance. Empire deemed Reservoir Dogs the \"Greatest Independent Film of All Time\". His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a comedy crime film, was a major success both among critics and audiences. He also wrote the screenplay for and starred in the vampire film From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Tarantino paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.\r\n\r\nKill Bill, a highly stylized \"revenge flick\" in the cinematic traditions of kung fu films, Japanese martial arts, and spaghetti westerns, followed six years later, and was released as two films: Volume 1 in 2003 and Volume 2 in 2004. Tarantino next directed the exploitation slasher film Death Proof in 2007, as part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez, released in the tradition of grindhouse cinema of the 1970s under the collective title Grindhouse. His long-postponed Inglourious Basterds, which tells an alternate history of Nazi Germany, was released in 2009 to positive reviews. After that came critically acclaimed Django Unchained (2012), a western film set in the Antebellum South. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was released in its roadshow version in 70 mm film format, with opening \"overture\" and halfway-point intermission. His ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, an alternate history of the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders, was released in 2019.\r\n\r\nTarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success as well as a dedicated cult-following. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and five Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him \"the single most influential director of his generation\". In December 2015, Tarantino received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, he married Israeli model-actress-singer Daniella Pick with whom he had a son, Leo, in February 2020.",

He is well-regarded for his cultural influence on 20th-century film. Brando was an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and Method Acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.\r\n\r\nHe initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and an Academy Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James Michener's 1954 novel.\r\n\r\nThe 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972). He got the part, and subsequently won his second Academy Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris, Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\r\n\r\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles, such as in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.\r\n\r\nBrando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century. In this list, Time also designated Brando as the \"Actor of the Century\".",

      "bio": "Francis Ford Coppola (born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, film composer, and vintner. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.\r\n\r\nAfter directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo).\r\n\r\nThe Godfather Part II, which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. The Conversation, which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, Apocalypse Now (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\r\n\r\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), the crime dramas The Cotton Club (1984) and The Godfather Part III (1990), and the horror film Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress Talia Shire; his daughter Sofia Coppola and granddaughter Gia Coppola are directors, and the actors Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are his nephews.

He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. Spielberg started in Hollywood directing television and several minor theatrical releases. He became a household name as the director of Jaws (1975), which was critically and commercially successful and is considered the first summer blockbuster. His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction/adventure films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993), which became archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.\r\n\r\nSpielberg transitioned into addressing serious issues in his later work with The Color Purple (1985), Empire of the Sun (1987), Schindler's List (1993), Amistad (1997), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). He has largely adhered to this practice during the 21st century, with Munich (2005), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017).\r\n\r\nHe co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Studios, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for several successful film trilogies, tetralogies and more including the Gremlins, Back to the Future, Men in Black, and the Transformers series. He later transitioned into producing several video games.\r\n\r\nSpielberg is one of the American film industry's most critically successful filmmakers, with praise for his directing talent and versatility, and he has won the Academy Award for Best Director twice. Some of his movies are also among the highest-grossing films, while his total work makes him the highest-grossing film director in history. His net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion.",

Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\r\n\r\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.\r\n\r\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre.

Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie, Zo\u00eb Bell, Kurt Russell, and others joined the cast between January and June 2018. Principal photography lasted from June through November around Los Angeles.

      "description": "The Hateful Eight (sometimes marketed as The H8ful Eight) is a 2015 American western thriller film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern as eight strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a stagecoach stopover some time after the American Civil War.\r\n\r\nTarantino announced The Hateful Eight in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his previous film Django Unchained (2012) before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script leaked in January 2014, he cancelled the film and instead directed a live reading at the United Artists Theater in Los Angeles, before reconsidering and resuming progress on the project. Filming began on December 8, 2014, near Telluride, Colorado. The original score was Italian composer Ennio Morricone's first for a Tarantino film, his first complete Western score in 34 years, and his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars in 2000.\r\n\r\nDistributed by The Weinstein Company in the United States, The Hateful Eight was released on December 25, 2015, in a limited roadshow release on 70 mm film, before expanding wide theatrically on December 30, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for Leigh's performance and Morricone's score. It grossed $155.8 million against a $45 million budget. For his work on the score, Morricone won his first Academy Award for Best Original Score, as well as the Golden Globe. The film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 2019, the film was released as a re-edited four-episode miniseries on Netflix with the subtitle Extended Version. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's final film to have the involvement of The Weinstein Company, as he ended his relationship with the company following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017.",

The film tells an alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel who is tracking down Raine's group and is connected to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film The Inglorious Bastards (1978).\r\n\r\nTarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film Kill Bill.

      "description": "Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who conceived it with Roger Avary. Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of criminal Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\r\n\r\nTarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\r\n\r\nPulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\r\n\r\nPulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing movies and other media that adopted elements of its style. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

      "description": "Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American independent crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino in his feature-length debut. It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen, Tarantino, and Edward Bunker, as diamond thieves whose planned heist of a jewelry store goes terribly wrong. The film depicts the events before and after the heist. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. It incorporates many motifs that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe film is regarded as a classic of independent film and a cult film, and was named \"Greatest Independent Film of all Time\" by Empire. Although controversial for its depictions of violence and use of profanity, Reservoir Dogs was generally well received, with the cast being praised by many critics. Despite not being heavily promoted during its theatrical run, the film became a modest success in the United States after grossing $2.8 million against its $1.2 million budget, and was more successful in the United Kingdom, grossing nearly \u00a36.5 million. It achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction (1994). A soundtrack was released featuring songs used in the film, which are mostly from the 1970s.",

      "description": "The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.\r\n\r\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.\r\n\r\nWhile The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $58.3 million.\r\n\r\nOver 320,000 VHS copies were shipped throughout the United States, and based on its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top rented films of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. It is now considered by many to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. As of 2017, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration, and naming the film as a favorite in various surveys. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

      "description": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film. They and Coppola disagreed over the casting for several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.\r\n\r\nThe Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 14, 1972, and was released wider in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made, with a gross between $246 million and $287 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in films such as Last Tango in Paris, Superman, and Apocalypse Now, Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director.\r\n\r\nSince its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990).",

      "description": "The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Mariana Hill, and Lee Strasberg. It is the second installment in The Godfather trilogy. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone (De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City.\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of the first film, Paramount Pictures began developing a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more control on the film, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to the film to tell the story of the rise of Vito and the fall of Michael.\r\n\r\nPrincipal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. The Godfather Part II premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics but its reputation, however, improved rapidly and it soon became the subject of critical re-evaluation. It grossed between $48\u201388 million worldwide on a $13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards at the 47th Academy Awards and became the first sequel to win for Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\r\n\r\nSome have deemed it superior to The Godfather. Both Part II and its predecessor remain highly influential films, especially in the gangster genre. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The final film in the trilogy, The Godfather Part III, was released in 1990.",

      "description": "The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second installment of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale and supported by Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne / Batman (Bale), Police Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City, but are menaced by an anarchistic mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger), who seeks to undermine Batman's influence and turn the city to chaos.\r\n\r\nNolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Harvey Dent's origin. The \"Dark Knight\" nickname was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger. The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. The film was the first mainstream feature to partially utilize IMAX 70 mm cameras, with Nolan using them for 28 minutes of the film, including the Joker's first appearance. Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker. Ledger died on January 22, 2008, some months after he completed filming and six months before the film's release from a toxic combination of prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public.\r\n\r\nUpon its release on July 18, 2008, The Dark Knight achieved significant critical and commercial success. With over $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it became the highest-grossing film of 2008 and is the 46th-highest-grossing film of all time, unadjusted for inflation (4th at the time of release); it also set the record for highest-grossing domestic opening with $158 million, a record it held for three years. The film received eight Academy Award nominations; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor. The Dark Knight is considered one of the best films of its decade and one of the best superhero films ever made. The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in the trilogy, was released on July 20, 2012.",

      "description": "Schindler's List is a 1993 American historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. The film follows Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten German businessman who together with his wife Emilie Schindler saved more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon G\u00f6th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.\r\n\r\nIdeas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\r\n\r\nPrincipal photography took place in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in black and white and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski wanted to create a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performed the main theme.\r\n\r\nSchindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made, it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, winning seven, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, and won numerous other awards, including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time.

It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom, and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.\r\n\r\nPrincipal photography took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.\r\n\r\nForrest Gump was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis' directing, Hanks' performance, the visual effects, the music and the script. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over US$677 million worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1994. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. Forrest Gump won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.\r\n\r\nVarying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism. In 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

      "description": "Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat. Set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy landings. The film follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of three servicemen killed in action. The film is a co-production between DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and Mutual Film Company, with DreamWorks distributing the film in North America while Paramount released the film internationally.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, producer Mark Gordon pitched Rodat's idea, which was inspired by the Niland brothers, to Paramount, which eventually began development on the project. Spielberg, who at the time was forming DreamWorks, came on board to direct the project, and Hanks joined the cast. After the cast went through training supervised by Marines veteran Dale Dye, the film's principal photography started in June 1997 and lasted two months. The film's D-Day scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland and used members of the army reserve of the Irish Army as infantry for the D-Day landing.\r\n\r\nReleased on July 24, 1998, Saving Private Ryan received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances (particularly from Hanks), realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's direction, and was placed on many film critics' 1998 top ten lists. It was also a box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1998 in the United States with $216.8 million domestically and the second-highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide with $481.8 million worldwide. Additionally, it grossed $44 million from its release on home video in May 1999. The film won several accolades, including Best Picture and Director at the Golden Globes, Producers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, and Critics' Choice Awards. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards at the 71st Academy Awards, where it won five awards including Spielberg's second win for Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though it lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love in a controversial upset.\r\n\r\nSince its release, Saving Private Ryan has been considered as one of the greatest films ever made and has been lauded as influential on the war film genre. It is credited for renewing interest in World War II media. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Saving Private Ryan as the 71st-greatest American movie in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and in 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

      "description": "Band of Brothers is a 2001 American war drama miniseries based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan and went on to do a following World War II production The Pacific. The episodes first started airing on HBO September 9, 2001. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe awards in 2001 for best miniseries.\r\n\r\nThe series dramatizes the history of \"Easy\" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 101st Airborne Division, from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, up until Japan's capitulation and the end of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to several episodes, with the men's real identities revealed in the finale.\r\n\r\nThe title for the book and series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series finale.",

      "description": "Goodfellas (stylized GoodFellas) is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese, produced by Irwin Winkler and distributed by Warner Bros. It is an adaptation of the 1985 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\r\n\r\nScorsese initially titled the film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\r\n\r\nGoodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with Silver Lion for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990. The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed $46.8 million. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, with Pesci winning for Best Supporting Actor. The film won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including Best Film and Best Director. Additionally, Goodfellas was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\r\n\r\nGoodfellas is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.",

It stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, with Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Anna Paquin, Stephen Graham, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Jesse Plemons, and Harvey Keitel in supporting roles. The film follows Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster Russell Bufalino (Pesci) and his crime family, including his time working for the powerful Teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino).\r\n\r\nIn September 2014, following years of development hell, The Irishman was announced as Scorsese's next film after Silence (2016). De Niro, who also served as producer, and Pacino were confirmed that month, as was Pesci, who came out of his unofficial retirement to star after numerous requests. Principal photography began in September 2017 in New York City and in the Mineola and Williston Park sections of Long Island, and wrapped in March 2018. Scenes were filmed with a custom three-camera rig to help facilitate the extensive de-aging digital effects that made De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger. With a production budget of $159\u2013200 million and a runtime of 209 minutes, it is the most expensive and longest film of Scorsese's career.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman premiered at the 57th New York Film Festival, and had a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on Netflix starting on November 27, 2019. It received critical acclaim, with praise for Scorsese's direction and the performances of De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. The film received numerous accolades; at the 92nd Academy Awards, it received 10 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Pacino and Pesci, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

      "description": "The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, which ultimately led to his downfall.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio, who was also a producer on the film, stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham, who tries to bring Belfort down. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), and Shutter Island (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter, since the television series Boardwalk Empire (2010\u201314).\r\n\r\nThe film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by Paramount Pictures, and was the first to be released entirely through digital distribution. It was a major commercial success, grossing $392 million worldwide during its theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film. The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use, and its use of animals during production. It set a Guinness World Record for the most instances of swearing in a film.\r\n\r\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction, DiCaprio\u2019s comedic performance and the fast-paced and consistent humor. It has also been criticized by many as glorifying the infamous individuals and immoral behaviors portrayed in the film. It was nominated for several awards, including five nominations at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations for DiCaprio and Hill, respectively. DiCaprio won Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy.",

The film reboots the Batman film series, telling the origin story of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop Ra's al Ghul and the Scarecrow from plunging Gotham City into chaos.\r\n\r\nFollowing the poor reception of Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), a series of unsuccessful attempts were made to resurrect Batman on the big screen which put the Batman film series on hold for nearly eight years. Then, in early 2003, Nolan and Goyer began work on Batman Begins. Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films. Comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One and Batman: The Long Halloween served as inspiration.\r\n\r\nBatman Begins opened on June 15, 2005, in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters. It grossed over $48 million in its opening weekend in North America, eventually grossing over $371 million worldwide. The film was met with highly positive reviews, with critics praising the tone, Bale's performance, action sequences, score, direction, and the emotional weight compared to previous Batman films. Often cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s, Batman Begins was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. It was followed by The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), with the three films constituting The Dark Knight Trilogy.",

      "description": "Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with his wife, Emma Thomas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a horror film envisioning \"dream stealers,\" based on lucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008. The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22. Its official budget was US$160 million, split between Warner Bros and Legendary. Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.\r\n\r\nInception's premiere was held in London on July 8, 2010; it was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters beginning on July 16, 2010. Inception grossed over US$829 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2010. Considered one of the best films of the 2010s, Inception received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, and ensemble cast. It won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.",

      "description": "The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer.[5] Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Morgan Freeman. Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, merciless revolutionary Bane forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"Knightfall\" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline \"No Man's Land\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2012.",

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles. The film is based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His foremost crime was check fraud; he became so highly skilled that the FBI later turned to him for help catching other check forgers.\r\n\r\nDevelopment for the film began in 1980 but dragged on until 1997, when Spielberg's DreamWorks bought the film rights to Abagnale's book. David Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, Milo\u0161 Forman and Cameron Crowe were all considered to direct the film before Spielberg decided to direct it himself. Filming took place from February to May 2002.\r\n\r\nThe film opened on December 25, 2002 to critical and commercial success. At the 75th Academy Awards, Christopher Walken and John Williams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Score.",

      "description": "Casino is a 1995 American epic crime film directed by Martin Scorsese, produced by Barbara De Fina and distributed by Universal Pictures. It starred Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci. The film is based on the nonfiction book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas[4] by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese. The film marks the eighth collaboration between director Scorsese and De Niro.\r\n\r\nCasino follows Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro), a Jewish American gambling expert handicapper who is asked by the Chicago Outfit to oversee the day-to-day casino and hotel operations at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Supporting characters include Nicholas \"Nicky\" Santoro (Pesci), a \"made man\" and friend of Ace, and Ginger McKenna (Stone), a streetwise chip hustler whom Ace marries and has a daughter with. The film details Ace's operation of the casino, the difficulties he confronts in his job, the Mafia's involvement with the casino, and the gradual breakdown of his relationships and standing, as Las Vegas changes over the years.\r\n\r\nThe primary characters are based on real people: Ace is inspired by the life of Frank Rosenthal, also known as \"Lefty,\" who ran the Stardust, Fremont, Marina, and Hacienda casinos in Las Vegas for the Chicago Outfit from the early 1970s until 1981. Nicky and Ginger are based on mob enforcer Anthony Spilotro and former dancer and socialite Geri McGee, respectively.\r\n\r\nCasino was released on November 22, 1995, to mostly positive critical reception, and was a worldwide box office success. Stone's performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.",

      "description": "Apocalypse Now is a 1979 American epic war film directed, produced and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola. It stars Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, and Dennis Hopper. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and John Milius and narration written by Michael Herr, was loosely based on the 1899 novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The setting was changed from late 19th-century Congo to the Vietnam War. The film follows a river journey from South Vietnam into Cambodia undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (a character based on Conrad's Marlow and played by Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Brando, with the character being based on Conrad's Mr. Kurtz), a renegade Army Special Forces officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\r\n\r\nMilius became interested in adapting Heart of Darkness for a Vietnam War setting, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and George Lucas as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directoral control, and was influenced by Werner Herzog's Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) in his approach to the material. Initially set to be a five-month shoot, the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year, as chronicled in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991). These problems included Brando arriving on the set overweight and completely unprepared, expensive sets being destroyed by severe weather and Sheen having a breakdown and suffering a near-fatal heart attack while on location. Problems continued after production as the release was postponed several times while Coppola edited over a million feet of film.\r\n\r\nApocalypse Now was honored with the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where it premiered unfinished before it was finally released on August 15, 1979, by United Artists. The film performed well at the box office, grossing $78 million domestically and going on to gross over $150 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed; while Vittorio Storaro's cinematography was widely acclaimed, several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing. Apocalypse Now is today considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards at the 52nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Supporting Actor for Duvall, and went on to win for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. It ranked No. 14 in Sight & Sound's greatest films poll in 2012, and No. 6 in the Director's Poll of greatest films of all time. Roger Ebert also included it in his top 10 list of greatest films ever in 2012. In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".",

      "title": "Brad Pitt Wins Best Supporting Actor Oscar",
      "description": "Brad Pitt Wins Best Supporting Actor Oscar\r\nIt's Pitt's first Academy Award in an acting category. He previously won as producer of \"12 Years a Slave.\"\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt has won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance as stunt double Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a fairly competitive category, Pitt beat out fellow nominees Tom Hanks (Fred Rogers in \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d), Anthony Hopkins (Pope Benedict XVI in \u201cThe Two Popes\u201d), Al Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa in \u201cThe Irishman\u201d), and Joe Pesci (Russell Bufalino in \u201cThe Irishman\u201d).\r\n\r\nThis is Pitt\u2019s fourth nomination as an actor, and his first acting Oscar win. Previously, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1996 for \u201c12 Monkeys,\u201d for Best Actor in 2009 for \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d for Best Actor in 2012 for \u201cMoneyball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a producer, he has three Best Picture nominations: \u201cMoneyball\u201d (2012), \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d (2014), and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d (2016). He won for \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d which was his first ever Oscar win.\r\n\r\nPitt already won both the Golden Globe and the SAG award in the Best Supporting Actor category, and was fully expected to win the Oscar as well.\r\n\r\nIndieWire awards editor Anne Thompson predicted that Pitt would win the category, with Anthony Hopkins (\u201cThe Two Popes\u201d) potentially playing spoiler. Her bottom line: \u201cNobody can possibly catch up with Pitt\u2019s performance as moccasin-wearing zen stuntman Cliff Booth, nor his awards circuit charm offensive (including witty, self-deprecating speeches \u2014 his ghost writer earned their fee \u2014 and hand-holding with his ex, Jennifer Aniston). While \u2018The Two Popes\u2019 is an unsung actor-fest that many voters love, Oscar voters want this key win for \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d received a total of 10 nominations. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2019, and was theatrically released in the U.S. on July 26, 2019.\r\n\r\nThe film has grossed $374 million worldwide and received universal praise from critics for Tarantino\u2019s screenplay and direction, acting, cinematography, costume design, production values, and soundtrack.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, during the final moments of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), former star of a 1950s western TV series, and his longtime stunt double and easygoing best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don\u2019t recognize anymore. But Rick has very famous next-door neighbors: Roman Polanski (Rafa\u0142 Zawierucha) and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) \u2014 the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.\r\n\r\nAs with any Tarantino film, the reception for \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d wasn\u2019t without controversy. Although its context is a possibly-skewed memory of Cliff Booth\u2019s, and not a \u201creal\u201d event in the narrative, the film\u2019s portrayal of Bruce Lee drew much criticism from fans, contemporaries and Lee\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a key fight sequence involving Pitt\u2019s character and Lee was the subject of much contention. In the scene, Lee challenges Cliff to a three-round fight on the set of \u201cThe Green Hornet\u201d after Cliff insults him. Lee wins the first round by knocking Cliff off his feet. Cliff wins round two by launching Lee into the side of a car. But just as the final round is to begin, a \u201cGreen Hornet\u201d stunt coordinator, played by Zo\u00eb Bell, arrives on set to puts an end to the contest, effectively calling the match a tie.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to stunt coordinator Robert Alonzo, the sequence was supposed to be much longer, with Cliff definitely beating Lee. But Pitt wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea of Lee losing the fight, and (along with Alonzo, who considers Lee a personal hero) petitioned Tarantino to alter the script, which he of course did.\r\n\r\nBut of Lee\u2019s general portrayal, daughter, Shannon, said this: \u201c[Bruce Lee] was continuously marginalized and treated like kind of a nuisance of a human being by white Hollywood, which is how he\u2019s treated in the film.\u201d\r\n\r\nTarantino responded to the criticism, saying Lee was \u201ckind of an arrogant guy\u201d, and that Lee\u2019s widow, Linda Lee Cadwell, wrote in her 1975 book \u201cBruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew,\u201d that he could beat Muhammad Ali. But Cadwell was actually quoting a TV critic. In 1972, Lee himself said: \u201cEverybody says I must fight Ali someday \u2026 Look at my hand. That\u2019s a little Chinese hand. He\u2019d kill me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d features a large ensemble cast led by DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, and Al Pacino.\r\n\r\nIt is the last film to feature Luke Perry, who died in March 2019.\r\n\r\nProduced by Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain \u2014 their first involvement with the Oscars \u2014 the 92nd Academy Awards were held on Sunday, February 9, 2020, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center, in Hollywood, and was televised live on ABC. The Oscars are also televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.",

      "title": "Bong Joon Ho Defeats Sam Mendes to Win Best Director Oscar in Nail-Biting Race",
      "description": "Bong's unprecedented win is the latest in a history-making night for South Korea's \"Parasite.\"\r\n\r\nEnding a nail-biting derby pitting Bong Joon Ho against Sam Mendes for Best Director, the South Korean filmmaker took home the Academy Award on Sunday night for his direction on \u201cParasite.\u201d While all signs throughout awards season had pointed to Mendes taking home the gold \u2014 including wins from the EE BAFTAs, the Directors Guild of America, and the Golden Globes \u2014 the love for \u201cParasite\u201d overpowered the \u201c1917\u201d narrative. Bong\u2019s win for Best Director adds to an already unprecedented set of wins for the film \u2014 three in total \u2014 which include Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature. These are all firsts for a Korean-language film.\r\n\r\nAlong with \u201c1917\u201d filmmaker Mendes, Bong also beat out Todd Phillips for \u201cJoker,\u201d Martin Scorsese for \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d All of those films are up for Best Picture as well, but that race at this point is between \u201c1917\u201d and \u201cParasite,\u201d barring a last-minute upset.\r\n\r\n\u201cParasite\u201d has been the darling of critics and audiences since it won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival back in May 2019 \u2014 also the first South Korean film ever to do so. Neon opened the film in October, and the film has already grossed $33 million in the United States and counting. Around the world, the film\u2019s box-office total exceeds $165 million, and as the movie is still in theaters (and also now available to stream), that number is only going to climb. After Oscar wins and record box office, though, the movie\u2019s legacy doesn\u2019t end here, as it was announced recently that Bong and Adam McKay will partner with HBO to adapt the film into a limited series. Plans are set to begin taking shape in March on what that series will look like.\r\n\r\nThe awards season haul for \u201cParasite\u201d has heretofore included more than 200 wins, including: the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture in a Foreign Language, the EE BAFTA Awards for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the Broadcast Film Critics Choice Awards for Best Director (tied with Sam Mendes for \u201c1917\u201d) and Best Foreign Language Film, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Film, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Song Kang-ho), and many, many more.\r\n\r\nBong Joon Ho\u2019s prior credits include arthouse favorites \u201cOkja,\u201d \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d \u201cThe Host,\u201d \u201cMemories of Murder,\u201d and \u201cBarking Dogs Never Bite.\u201d With \u201cParasite\u201d awards-season chores now out of the way, he will turn his attention to the HBO version of the film. It remains to be seen whether the next iteration of \u201cParasite\u201d will unfold in English or Korean, but Bong recently did offer a tease of his thoughts on what\u2019s to come for the limited series adaptation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really liked Adam McKay\u2019s \u2018The Big Short\u2019 and I loved his sense of humor, and the sharp satire he conveyed about the current American politics,\u201d Bong said of his creative partner on the series. \u201cWith \u2018Parasite,\u2019 while I was writing the script I had so many more ideas I couldn\u2019t convey into the two-hour running time of the film. I knew that if I had a longer running time, I would be able to tell these stories, and I that\u2019s what I plan to talk about with Adam pretty soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThough I\u2019m not very familiar with the TV industry, I really consider this limited series an expanded film that can delve deeper into the stories that didn\u2019t make it into \u2018Parasite.\u2019 Adam McKay and HBO have created the amazing show \u2018Succession,\u2019 so they\u2019re very reliable and amazing partners to have,\u201d Bong said. He also cited Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1982 miniseries \u201cFanny and Alexander\u201d as a potential influence.\r\n\r\nDespite his success on the heels of \u201cParasite,\u201d however, Bong Joon Ho told IndieWire he has no plans to sell out and direct a tentpole or, say, foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \u201cI received a lot of [Hollywood] offers after \u2018The Host\u2019 in 2006,\u201d Bong said. \u201cLots of science-fiction, horror, and action films. I was just like, \u2018Wow, a Hollywood script!\u2019 I didn\u2019t accept any of them. My agent is a very nice guy and they already know that I like to direct my own scripts like Quentin Tarantino. Sometimes I do get a little disappointed that he doesn\u2019t send me anything. He doesn\u2019t send me any scripts now knowing that I always write my own.\u201d\r\n\r\nFollow all of IndieWire\u2019s 2020 Academy Awards coverage here, and see the full list of tonight\u2019s winners here.",

      "description": "Quentin Tarantino celebrates his 57th birthday on March 27, 2020. The Oscar-winning writer-director redefined independent cinema with his pulpy mix of violence, dark humor and pop culture, crafting several modern classics. In honor of his birthday, let\u2019s take a look back at all 10 of his films, ranked worst to best.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1963, Tarantino made a living as a video store clerk while penning spec scripts. He made his directorial debut with \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d (1992), a \u201cRashomon\u201d-esque crime drama about a botched jewel heist. Two more of his scripts, \u201cTrue Romance\u201d (1993) and \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d (1994), were later produced by Tony Scott and Oliver Stone, respectively.\r\n\r\nHe hit the Oscar jackpot just two years after his filmmaking debut with \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994), a multi-narrative, self-referential pastiche about a group of criminals whose lives intersect in surprising ways. After winning the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, the indie hit went on to collect a screenwriting prize for Tarantino and Roger Avery, earning nominations in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (John Travolta), Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman) and Best Film Editing. A slew of imitators followed, none matching the original\u2019s blend of carnage, comedy, and pop culture.\r\n\r\nTarantino returned to the Oscar race with his World War II epic \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (2009), which brought him nominations for writing and directing. He collected his second trophy in Best Original Screenplay three years later for \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), a spaghetti western homage about a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) searching for his wife in the Civil War-era South. Both films competed in Best Picture, and both reaped Best Supporting Actor victories for Christoph Waltz.\r\n\r\nHe wracked up three more nominations for his latest outing, the 2019 release, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d A loving tribute to the movies, music and television of 1969 Los Angeles, the film personally brought him 2020 bids for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay (plus ones for stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, who won the Best Supporting Actor prize).",

      "title": "Baz Luhrmann Confirms Halting of \u2018Elvis\u2019 Project With Tom Hanks",
      "description": "Australian director Baz Luhrmann says that now is not the moment to be resuming production on his untitled \u201cElvis\u201d project. The film was halted since last week, when actor Tom Hanks was diagnosed with the corovavirus.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet on Friday afternoon Luhrmann said: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will come as no surprise that this is not the moment to be resuming production on the film. Please know that this is in now way a reflection our commitment to making the movie here in Queensland. In fact we are not even taking our sets down, simply locking up the creative space over the next few days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spoken to the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, and we all agree that right now, this is the time for people all over the world, from all walks of life, to be at home indoors, with their loved ones (washing our hands five time a day). All going well we have a passionate conviction to be back here on the Gold Coast, picking up where we left off as soon as the time is right. Baz.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen that could possibly be was thrown into further doubt when Australia announced that it was effectively sealing its borders to all foreigners who are not permanent residents. The move takes affect from 9pm Friday. The country has more than 700 confirmed coronavirus cases, with the significant majority imported with returning travelers, or people in close contact with them.\r\n\r\nBacked by Warner Bros., the film in advanced pre-production, with shooting set to have begun next week. Austin Butler is to play Presley, Maggie Gyllenhaal the star\u2019s mother Gladys. Hanks is to play Col. Tom Parker, Presley\u2019s all-controlling manager.\r\n\r\nLuhrmann co-wrote the script with Craig Pearce. The movie covers the relationship between the veteran manager and the young singer, who came from dirt-poor origins to become an iconic star who changed the course of music. The project marks Luhrmann\u2019s first film since his adaptation of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio. He most recently worked on the Netflix series \u201cThe Get Down.\u201d\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Presley talked about his devotion to his mother, constantly calling her his number one girl. The close relationship is said to have continued when the musician\u2019s career took off and during Gladys\u2019 bout of depression due to his time away from home.\r\n\r\nThe production was expected to employ 900 Queenslanders in behind-the-scenes roles, including set construction, catering and transportation, and inject more than $105 million into the local economy, Palaszczuk announced last May when it was announced that Queensland and the Village Roadshow Studios, on the Gold Coast, had secured the film to shoot in the territory.\r\n\r\nHanks revealed on March 12 that he and his wife Rita had tested positive for the coronavirus. They were admitted to hospital and have since been released into self-isolation in an apartment. On Wednesday Hanks tweeted that the pair remain stable and cheerful, living a quarantine period playing cards, doing the laundry and working a Corona typewriter.",

      "title": "Quentin Tarantino Talks About the Luke Cage Movie He Almost Made",
      "description": "Once upon a time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino toyed with bringing Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage to the screen. This was admittedly early in his career\u2014after he\u2019d directed Reservoir Dogs to critical and commercial acclaim but before he\u2019d even shot the \u201890s-defining Pulp Fiction\u2014and well before our current Marvel Studios glut. Nevertheless, he still gets nostalgic about the project. For instance, while it\u2019s been known he considered Laurence Fishburne to play the unbreakable man, he just revealed that he also thought about Wesley Snipes in the role.\r\n\r\nThis and more came up during Tarantino\u2019s fascinating conversation on Amy Schumer\u2019s podcast, 3 Girls, 1 Keith. Tarantino came on to discuss his career and his recent Oscar winning work, Once Upon a Time\u2026 in Hollywood, but the conversation eventually turned to one of the most popular genres on screen at the moment: superheroes. This occurred when co-host Keith Robinson brought up Martin Scorsese\u2019s recent comments about Marvel Studios movies being more like theme parks than cinema.\r\n\r\n\u201cGenerationally does anyone think he is going to be a big fan of Captain Marvel or Doctor Strange and Ant-Man vs. the Wasp?\u201d Tarantino laughed while amusingly renaming one of Marvel\u2019s lesser efforts. \u201cYou could\u2019ve guessed THAT would\u2019ve been his reaction.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Tarantino then thought back to his own love for Marvel Comics growing up and how he toyed with adapting Luke Cage back in an era where future Tarantino co-star George Clooney was still building up to his Batman moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a time before all this Marvel shit was coming out,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cIt was after Reservoir Dogs, it was before Pulp Fiction, and I had thought about doing Luke Cage. Growing up I was a big comic book collector, and my two favorite [comic books] were Luke Cage: Hero for Hire, later Luke Cage: Power Man, and Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu. I also liked Werewolf by Night, that was a great one, and Tomb of Dracula was great, but my absolute hero was Luke Cage.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter going on to stress that he was the only white guy he knew who collected Luke Cage comics over all other superheroes, Tarantino noted that this would not have replaced Pulp Fiction as his second film. Rather it could\u2019ve been his third movie instead of Jackie Brown. He just couldn\u2019t settle on casting.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat actually dissuaded me from doing it\u2026 was my comic geek friends talked me out of it,\u201d Tarantino explained. \u201cBecause I had an idea that Larry Fishburne would\u2019ve been the perfect guy to play Luke Cage. And I\u2019m talking King of New York era Larry Fishburne. \u2018My name is Jimmy Jump.\u2019 \u2026 But All my friends were like, \u2018No, no, listen, it\u2019s got to be Wesley Snipes.\u2019 And I go, \u2018Look, I like Wesley Snipes, but Larry Fishburne is practically Marlon Brando. I think Fish is the man.\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, but he\u2019d have to get in shape in a big way. Snipes is that way already!\u2019 And I go, \u2018Fuck that! That\u2019s not that important! Fuck you, you ruined the whole damn thing!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThat might be true, although we also wonder if the fact Pulp Fiction went on to be a cultural phenomenon, winning the Palme d\u2019Or at its Cannes premiere and going on to earn $214 million at the box office while racking up Tarantino\u2019s first screenplay Oscar, also had a little something to do with him stepping away from comic book movies. Then again, he did follow up Jackie Brown with an unapologetic paean to Kung Fu films, Samurai epics, and Spaghetti Westerns with the Kill Bill saga, and then pivoted to straight grindhouse exploitation via Death Proof.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting though to wonder how the superhero genre might\u2019ve been affected if Tarantino did a Kill Bill styled epic decades before the likes of Christopher Nolan or then the Marvel assembly line defined it in the 21st century. Then again, we\u2019re very happy to have Jackie Brown in this world, one of Tarantino\u2019s best (and most underrated) films. Snipes, meanwhile, got to star as a Marvel Comics superhero after all when he played Blade, a character spun off from the Tomb of Dracula comics!\r\n\r\nNo matter what, it\u2019s good to know that even in the \u201890s, comic book fan casting would still miss the mark by focusing purely on physical aesthetics instead of talent\u2026",

      "title": "Martin Scorsese's 10 Most Suspenseful Sequences",
      "description": "Martin Scorsese may not make a lot of thrillers, but the acclaimed director knows how to keep tension high in movies like Goodfellas and The Departed.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most gifted and prolific directors working today, Martin Scorsese can balance a wide range of cinematic tones. He\u2019s worked across a variety of different genres and, by extension, a variety of different emotions. His films have given viewers scenes that are heartbreaking, hilarious, harrowing, and scenes that keep us on the edge of our seats.\r\n\r\nScorsese has only directed a couple of thrillers and tends to go for more cerebral subject matter, but he\u2019s delivered his fair share of anxiety-fueled set pieces. So, here are the 10 most suspenseful scenes from Scorsese\u2019s filmography.\r\n\r\n10\r\nThe XF-11 Crash (The Aviator)\r\n\r\nOne of Scorsese\u2019s most overlooked gems is The Aviator, his spectacularly made biopic of Howard Hughes. In one of the film\u2019s most breathtaking sequences, Hughes takes the prototype XF-11 airplane for a spin.\r\n\r\nSomething goes horribly wrong, and the plane begins plummeting towards the Earth, eventually crashing on a suburban street in Beverly Hills. In this scene, Scorsese perfectly captures the panic of being in a plane that\u2019s going down.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\u201cFunny How?\u201d (Goodfellas)\r\n\r\nThe suspense in this scene is not a result of well-paced editing or in-camera trickery; it\u2019s entirely down to the power of Joe Pesci\u2019s performance. Pesci\u2019s character Tommy DeVito tells his friends an anecdote at the bar and Ray Liotta\u2019s Henry Hill tells him he\u2019s a funny guy. Suddenly, the atmosphere sours as Tommy is offended and asks Henry what he means by \u201cfunny.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a furious tirade followed by a few tense moments of silence, Henry says, \u201cGet the f*ck outta here, Tommy!,\u201d and everyone at the table starts laughing as the whole thing is revealed to be a prank.\r\n\r\n8\r\nJordan Belfort Takes Quaaludes (The Wolf Of Wall Street)\r\n\r\nScorsese\u2019s riotous pitch-black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street has been accused of glorifying the lifestyle of scam-happy stockbroker Jordan Belfort, but Belfort\u2019s desperate struggle to get home while tripping on Quaaludes doesn\u2019t look too fun. Assuming the drugs weren\u2019t working, he took a bunch of them, and then drove to the country club to take a call, learning that his phones have been tapped by the feds.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the drugs hit. As the \u2018ludes take effect, the audience, like Belfort, doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and as funny as the on-screen events may be, that uncertainty keeps us on the edge of our seats.\r\n\r\n7\r\nDaniels Breaks Into Ward C (Shutter Island)\r\n\r\nWhenever a character in a movie is prohibited from going somewhere, there\u2019s inevitably a scene in which they go to that place. In Shutter Island, Teddy Daniels breaks into the restricted Ward C to find some answers. It\u2019s a terrifying scene as it\u2019s unclear what Daniels will find in there.\r\n\r\nIn the ward, he meets George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement who desperately tries to convince Daniels that he\u2019s being tricked and he\u2019s part of a huge conspiracy. At the time, Noyce sounds like the craziest character of all, but he later turns out to be the only one telling the truth.\r\n\r\n6\r\nCostigan Chases Sullivan Through Chinatown (The Departed)\r\n\r\nThe Departed is a special kind of cat-and-mouse thriller because it\u2019s not just about one cat chasing one mouse; the mouse is also chasing the cat. Colin Sullivan is a corrupt cop on mob boss Frank Costello\u2019s payroll, and Billy Costigan is an undercover cop who\u2019s infiltrated Costello\u2019s crew, and they\u2019re each trying to figure out the other\u2019s identity.\r\n\r\nAt the movie\u2019s midpoint, they come very close to a confrontation as Costigan chases Sullivan through the crowded streets of Chinatown. Although neither of them sees the other\u2019s face, it\u2019s an incredibly suspenseful sequence.\r\n\r\n5\r\nFrank Flies Out To Kill Jimmy (The Irishman)\r\n\r\nOne of Scorsese\u2019s directorial hallmarks is choosing the perfect track from his record collection to play over a given scene. But in The Irishman, when Frank Sheeran is sent to fly out to his close friend and associate Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s house to kill him, Scorsese lets the entire 20-minute sequence play out in near-silence. Without music to distract us, we\u2019re left with all the thoughts that are going through Frank\u2019s head as he\u2019s sent to perform this grisly deed.\r\n\r\nThe whole time, we know the outcome is inevitable, but there\u2019s a hope that maybe Frank will change his mind at the last second. And then, of course, he doesn\u2019t, and the killing is depicted very bluntly.\r\n\r\n4\r\nThe Thumb-Sucking Scene (Cape Fear)\r\nJuliette Lewis in Cape Fear\r\nAfter the sadistic Max Cady is released from prison, he\u2019s determined to exact revenge on Sam Bowden, the public defender who got him locked away, and his family. In one of Cape Fear\u2019s creepiest scenes, Cady approaches Bowden\u2019s teenage daughter Danielle at school under the guise of her new drama teacher. He kisses her and puts his thumb in her mouth.\r\n\r\nSince we know who Cady is, and Danielle doesn\u2019t \u2014 not to mention that the actual content of the scene is disturbing \u2014 we\u2019re fraught with anxiety throughout the whole sequence.\r\n\r\n3\r\nTravis Bickle Attempts To Assassinate Senator Palantine (Taxi Driver)\r\n\r\nAfter being dumped by one of Senator Palantine\u2019s employees, condescended to in his cab by Palatine himself, and generally disappointed by Palantine\u2019s management of his city, New York\u2019s self-appointed savior Travis Bickle heads down to one of his campaign rallies to assassinate him.\r\n\r\nTo Palantine, Travis is just a face in the crowd, but we know his intentions. Before the Vietnam vet can pull the trigger, he\u2019s spotted by some Secret Service agents and flees the scene.\r\n\r\n2\r\nThe Lighthouse Scene (Shutter Island)\r\n\r\nWhen Shutter Island, the closest thing Scorsese has made to a horror movie, comes to a head in its final act, Teddy Daniels arrives at the lighthouse where patients get lobotomized; the place that holds the answers to his questions.\r\n\r\nThose answers could provide some much-needed relief, or they could provide an outcome more shocking and horrifying than Daniels \u2014 or the audience \u2014 ever imagined. Of course, the latter turns out to be the case.\r\n\r\n1\r\nHenry Is Followed By A Helicopter (Goodfellas)\r\n\r\nIn the climactic sequence of Goodfellas, arguably Scorsese\u2019s masterpiece, Henry Hill is organizing a huge drug deal, racing all over town to put it together. Mentally, he\u2019s all over the place as he\u2019s descended into cocaine addiction from getting high on his own supply. And then, he spots a helicopter in the sky, and fears he\u2019s being followed by the feds.\r\n\r\nScorsese does a fantastic job of reflecting Henry\u2019s headspace with the cinematography, editing, and music. As the camera deliberately hides the helicopter, and the soundtrack goes through five abrupt song changes, it\u2019s unclear whether or not the helicopter is a delusional result of Henry\u2019s drug-addled paranoia \u2014 until there\u2019s a gun pointed at his head.",

      "title": "Trailer Lands For WWII Epic \u2018Greyhound\u2019 With Tom Hanks",
      "description": "Greyhound movie trailer\r\nSony Pictures has dropped the first-look trailer for the upcoming WWII movie Greyhound starring Tom Hanks and Stephen Graham. The film looks absolutely amazing and will land on our cinema screens later in 2020. Tom Hanks actually wrote the screenplay for the movie. It is directed by Aaron Schneider, an Oscar-winner for his short movie \u2018Two Soldier\u2019 back in 2004. Watch the Greyhound movie trailer in the player below.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis:\r\n\r\nIn the early days of WWII, an international convoy of 37 Allied ships, led by captain Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) in his first command of a U.S. destroyer, crosses the treacherous North Atlantic while hotly pursued by wolf packs of Nazi U-boats.\r\n\r\nShooting on Greyhound commenced two years ago at the beginning of 2018. It was originally set for release last March but finds its way onto the silver screen from 12th June this year. There are tons of special visual effects in this and it sure does look impressive from its debut trailer.\r\n\r\nAlso amongst the cast of Greyhound are Elisabeth Shue, Rob Morgan, Karl Glusman, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. The movie is an adaptation of the book \u2018The Good Shepherd\u2019 by C. S. Forester.\r\n\r\nHanks was most recently seen in the superb A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood. He has a few other projects lined up, including an English language remake of A Man Called Ove, a Paul Greengrass-directed movie titled News Of The World, and Baz Luhrmann\u2019s untitled Elvis Presley movie in which he plays Elvis\u2019 manager Colonel Tom Parker.\r\n\r\nThe impressive Stephen Graham was in Martin Scorsese\u2019s applauded The Irishman and is currently shooting a one-shot kitchen/restaurant-set drama titled Boiling Point.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the superb Greyhound movie trailer below. We\u2019ll bring you more as it comes our way in the months leading up until the film\u2019s release date this summer.",

      "title": "Rumor: Martin Scorsese Wants to Move \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019 to Netflix as the Budget Skyrockets to $225 Million",
      "description": "It looks like Martin Scorsese is missing his pals at Netflix. The streaming giant essentially gave Scorsese a blank check to make The Irishman, and now that the legendary filmmaker is back working with a regular studio, he\u2019s reportedly getting nostalgic for that Netflix freedom. Scorsese is currently working on Killers of the Flower Moon, which stars both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. The movie already has a budget over $220 million dollars, which is rumored to be giving studio Paramount more than a few sleepless nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Rushfield broke this story in his Ankler newsletter, stating that there are rumors swirling that Netflix could swoop in and grab Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon. Rushfield states these are nothing but rumors for now, but does add that even if Netflix doesn\u2019t come to the rescue, Scorsese would sure like them to. As the story goes, Paramount is nervous about Flower Moon\u2018s current $225 million budget \u2013 and not even the presence of box office draw Leonardo DiCaprio is soothing these worries.\r\n\r\nScorsese had money to burn and a wealth of freedom on the Netflix-released The Irishman, and Paramount\u2019s worry over the budget seems to have him pining for that sweet, sweet Netflix support system. Again: None of this means Netflix is going to ride in on a white horse and take Killers of the Flower Moon away. Still, it\u2019s interesting to learn how fond of Netflix Scorsese has become \u2013 and who can blame him? He\u2019s been making movies the old fashioned way for decades, and then Netflix went ahead and gave him tons of money and freedom to do whatever the heck he wanted. Who wouldn\u2019t want to return to that?\r\n\r\nBased on a true story, and the book of the same name by David Gran, Killers of the Flower Moon tells the story of the Osage murders of the 1920s. At the time, the Osage Nation in Oklahoma had become extremely wealthy due to oil being discovered beneath their land. Then, as the book jacket explains \u201cone by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.\u201d The FBI, still in its infancy at the time, began investigating, and sent in a former Texas Ranger, Tom White, to try to find the killer (or killers). White put together an undercover team to get to the bottom of things, and ended up exposing a conspiracy in the process.\r\n\r\nAs a lifelong Scorsese fan, I\u2019m of the opinion that studios and producers should give him as much damn money and freedom as he wants to get his films made, but hey, that\u2019s me. Scorsese is set to start shooting Killers of the Flower Moon next month.",

      "title": "What Al Pacino Brought to Hunters",
      "description": "Legendary actor Al Pacino took Hunters -- his first regular TV series -- to a whole new level.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering why you haven\u2019t seen Al Pacino on TV much over the years, the answer is simple: the iconic star of films like The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, and Scarface hasn\u2019t done much work on the small screen during his more than five decades as an actor.\r\n\r\nFollowing a guest shot on a long-forgotten 1968 series called N.Y.P.D., Pacino did not show up on TV again until 2003, when he played the evil real-life lawyer Roy Cohn on HBO\u2019s six-part adaptation of Angels in America. Since then, he\u2019s done the TV/cable movies You Don\u2019t Know Jack (2010), Phil Spector (2013) and Paterno (2018). But he\u2019s never had a regular role on an episodic series \u2014 until now.\r\n\r\nOn the new Amazon Prime show Hunters, Pacino plays Meyer Offerman, a Holocaust survivor who leads a diverse group of Nazi hunters tracking down escaped Third Reich monsters in 1977 America. The series is a provocative, combustive mix of Tarantino-esque violence, comic book sensibility and somber reflection \u2014 the latter taking up more and more of the show as Offerman and his band of assassins begin to feel the effects of the violence and bloodshed they are immersing themselves in.\r\n\r\n\u201cAl\u2019s agent read the script and thought that there was something in this character that Al would really spark too,\u201d says series creator and co-executive producer David Weil. \u201cAnd Al did. It took four meetings to really talk with about this character is going and where the series is going. But just from day one with Al, it became a partnership. It became the greatest collaboration.\u201d\r\n\r\nA Method actor and former student at New York\u2019s legendary Actor\u2019s Studio, the 79-year-old Pacino still back on his training from years ago while prepping for the role in Hunters. \u201cThis is a person, an artist who eats, breathes and dreams his work and his characters,\u201d continues Weil about his star. \u201cHe\u2019ll always send a note in the middle of the night: \u2018Oh, what if we did this? Or maybe we should change the line to that? Or what if I was wearing a scarf instead?\u2019 Both minute details and grand ideas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAl is a guy that asks a lot of questions about the character, about what the intention of the line is, what the intention of a scene is,\u201d says co-executive producer Nikki Toscano. \u201cSo there\u2019s this wonderful, alive workshopping that\u2019s happening at all times and you don\u2019t often get that with a TV series because of the timing. You have to be moving so fast. But he allowed it to sort of slow down and give us the opportunity to have those conversations that sometimes you\u2019re not able to have.\u201d\r\n\r\nToscano adds that having an actor of Pacino\u2019s stature \u2014 he also recently starred in Martin Scorsese\u2019s epic The Irishman \u2014 agree to play a starring role in his first TV series raises not just the show\u2019s profile but the standard of excellence for everyone involved. \u201cIt takes it to a different level,\u201d she affirms. \u201cIt was life-changing. It obviously raises the profile of any show when you have Al Pacino doing his first bout of television on your series. And Al, without even meaning to be, is a really truly inspiring man. And he takes his craft so seriously that I think that he raised the bar for all of us to bring our A game.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Meyer Offerman\u2019s arc in Hunters takes the character and Pacino to some rather unexpected places as the series progresses, Weil agrees that the actor\u2019s influence on the ensemble of actors as a whole is clearly evident: \u201cAl really breathed this character to life in this beautiful way,\u201d says the showrunner. \u201cAl and the actors really became this wonderful troupe, and I think we all became this company, almost putting on this play for six months, and really exploring and improvising. It was just a wonderful, magical process.\u201d",

      "title": "10 Actors Who Were Almost Cast In Steven Spielberg Movies",
      "description": "Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous filmmaker working in Hollywood today. Actors are dying to work with him, but not everyone makes the cut.\r\n\r\nWhile he faces stiff competition from his contemporary Martin Scorsese for the title of greatest living director, Steven Spielberg is arguably the world\u2019s most famous filmmaker. Everyone\u2019s heard of Spielberg, everyone\u2019s seen at least a couple of his movies, and every actor in Hollywood is dying to work with him.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the director can pretty much cast anyone he wants in each role in his movies. However, sometimes the stars don\u2019t align, and there are scheduling conflicts or the material fails to connect with the producers\u2019 top choice for a role. So, here are 10 actors who almost landed roles in the films of Steven Spielberg.\r\n\r\n10\r\nSean Connery As John Hammond In Jurassic Park\r\n\r\nWhen Steven Spielberg was casting Jurassic Park, he offered Sean Connery the role of the park\u2019s creator John Hammond \u2014 described by the source novel\u2019s author Michael Crichton as a dark inversion of Walt Disney \u2014 based on the strength of his performance as Indy\u2019s father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\r\n\r\nHowever, Connery turned the role down. Hammond ended up being played by Richard Attenborough, who Spielberg cast because he felt that a fellow filmmaker could get into the mindset of an egocentric creator who\u2019s dangerously mad with power.\r\n\r\n9\r\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd As Oskar Schindler In Schindler\u2019s List\r\n\r\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd was considered for the Oskar Schindler role in Schindler\u2019s List, which ended up being played by Liam Neeson. Funnily enough, about a decade later, Neeson was set to appear as Father Frank Merrin in Exorcist: The Beginning, but he dropped out, only to be replaced by Skarsg\u00e5rd.\r\n\r\nBefore Neeson was given the role of Schindler, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty were also considered for the part.\r\n\r\n8\r\nLaurence Olivier As The Grail Knight In Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade\r\n\r\nThe role of the Grail Knight in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a small but significant one. Initially, the producers wanted the part to be played by Laurence Olivier, who was widely regarded to be the finest British actor of the 20th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, due to his declining health, Olivier was unable to take the role, and passed away just a short while after the movie was released in 1989.\r\n\r\n7\r\nAl Pacino As Roy Neary In Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\r\n\r\nRichard Dreyfuss was the top choice for the role of Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but the studio was unwilling to meet his demands of $500,000 plus a percentage of the box office gross.\r\n\r\nSo, the role was offered to Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, and Gene Hackman. Nicholson worried the special effects would distract from his performance, Pacino simply wasn\u2019t interested, and Hackman couldn\u2019t leave L.A. for four months because his marriage was teetering on the brink of destruction. When James Caan wanted $1 million and 10% of the gross, the producers realized that Dreyfuss\u2019 price wasn\u2019t too high after all.\r\n\r\n6\r\nEdward Norton As Private Ryan In Saving Private Ryan\r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg offered the role of Private Ryan in Saving Private Ryan to Edward Norton, but he turned it down to appear in American History X. The role ended up going to Matt Damon, who was introduced to Spielberg by his Good Will Hunting co-star Robin Williams.\r\n\r\nNorton ended up competing with Saving Private Ryan\u2019s Tom Hanks for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 1999 ceremony. In the end, neither of them won, as the award went to Roberto Benigni for his performance in Life is Beautiful.\r\n\r\n5\r\nLiam Neeson As Abraham Lincoln In Lincoln\r\n\r\nWhen Steven Spielberg\u2019s biopic of Abraham Lincoln first entered development, Liam Neeson became attached to play Honest Abe. However, midway through development, he decided that he was too old to play the character, and dropped out of the project.\r\n\r\nThis allowed Spielberg to go with his original choice for the role, Daniel Day-Lewis, who\u2019s only five years younger than Neeson. Day-Lewis was reluctant to take the part, feeling he couldn\u2019t play such a historical icon. It was Leonardo DiCaprio who convinced Day-Lewis to take the role, although it\u2019s unclear what he said to persuade him.\r\n\r\n4\r\nJavier Bardem As Witwer In Minority Report\r\n\r\nMinority Report was delayed for a few years after Steven Spielberg took over his late friend Stanley Kubrick\u2019s final project A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Tom Cruise was the only actor who remained attached through the delay. At the time, the movie would\u2019ve starred Ian McKellen as Burgess, Cate Blanchett as Agatha, Matt Damon as Witwer, and Jenna Elfman as Lara Anderton.\r\n\r\nAfter the delay, Javier Bardem was offered the role of Witwer, but turned it down because he didn\u2019t want to spend months of his life chasing Tom Cruise around. So, Colin Farrell was cast in the role.\r\n\r\n3\r\nRobert Duvall As Chief Brody In Jaws\r\n\r\nRobert Duvall had encouraged Steven Spielberg to direct Jaws because he wanted to play Quint. However, Spielberg felt that Duvall was too young for the part, and cast Robert Shaw in the role instead.\r\n\r\nSpielberg offered the lead role of Chief Brody to Duvall instead, but the actor turned it down because he feared it would make him too famous. As Bob Balaban once reportedly said, \u201cNever be hot, always be warm.\u201d\r\n\r\n2\r\nHarrison Ford As Dr. Alan Grant In Jurassic Park\r\n\r\nThe role of Dr. Alan Grant in Jurassic Park was originally offered to Harrison Ford, but he turned it down, because he simply didn\u2019t feel like he was right for the part.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing part of the finished movie with Sam Neill in the role (Ford has still never seen Jurassic Park all the way through), Ford maintained that it was the right decision to turn it down. If Ford had played Grant, he might have been too similar to Indiana Jones, whereas Neill made the character feel unique.\r\n\r\n1\r\nTom Selleck As Indiana Jones In Raiders Of The Lost Ark\r\n\r\nCasting Indiana Jones was tricky, but even when it became apparent that Harrison Ford was the perfect choice for the role, George Lucas was reluctant to cast him.\r\n\r\nHaving cast Ford in his previous two movies, American Graffiti and Star Wars, Lucas didn\u2019t want to get pigeonholed in a Scorsese/De Niro dynamic with the actor. Tom Selleck came close to clinching the role \u2014 even wowing producers with a screen test \u2014 but fate had other plans. Selleck\u2019s pilot Magnum, P.I. got picked up, meaning he couldn\u2019t take the role of Indy. So, the part went to Ford after all, and film history was made.",

      "title": "10 Things Everyone Completely Missed In The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy",
      "description": "The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is a beloved film series. While many dedicated their time watching them, there may be some things they have missed.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy features three very, very long films: The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return Of The King. It's no wonder, therefore, that there are some parts of the movies that slip past our radar without us noticing anything odd about them.\r\n\r\nWhat with several interlocking narratives, endless middle-earth derived fictional names to keep track of, and a new war seeming to break out every other scene...one can hardly keep up with all the details. Here are 10 things to keep in mind the next time you're viewing these epic movies.\r\n10 Gandalf The White's High Tops\r\n\r\nYes, you read that right. In the first scene of Gandalf's return in The Two Towers, Gandalf is seen to step out into a great field and whistle for his horse, Shadowfax. for just a second, if you look to the bottom left of the screen as the camera zooms out and Gandalf's robes hang forward from his legs a bit, you can spot what clearly appears to be a pair of white Converse-style white high-tops on his feet. Whether they are true Converse sneakers is hard to tell for certain, but what is apparent is that he is not sporting the same footwear in later scenes.\r\n9 Sauron Loses The War...But Still Has 10,000 Soldiers?\r\n\r\nThe war at Minis Tirith is the subject of much debate and grief in the third movie of the series, The Return Of The King. Most are certain that man will fall to the massive armies of Sauron. They are so desperate that Aragorn even goes so far as to take the risk of traveling deep into the caves and asking an army of the dead to aid them in the battle. Lo and behold, they all come together and defeat Sauron's army by the skin of their teeth. Why, then, do we find out a few scenes later, that Sauron has an army of 10,000 soldiers which Gandalf suggests will impede Frodo from reaching Mount Doom? They are just...hanging out there?\r\n8 If The Orcs Know Frodo Is In Mordor, So Would Sauron\r\n\r\nAragorn takes an army--where he finds this army after just barely winning a war is hard to know--and marches to the gates of Mordor in an attempt to distract Sauron from the fact that Frodo is currently making his way through Mordor to destroy the ring. A representative of Sauron's army emerges and produces Frodo's elvish armor which he lost when temporarily taken captive by the Orcs. Now, the Orcs at the time seemingly had no idea who Frodo even was. To have the head of Sauron's army know that Frodo is there means Sauron knows, making the play at a distraction a moot point.\r\n7 Frodo Doesn't Technically Destroy The Ring\r\n\r\nFrodo finally makes it to Mount Doom, but when he walks in the entrance and faces the lava, he ignores poor, exhausted Sam's plea to destroy the ring. Instead, he looks Sam in the eye, proclaims \"the ring is mine,\" and puts it on his finger, going invisible. If Golem had not seen his footprints and tackled him, causing them both to scuffle for the ring and ultimately sending Golem to his death along with the ring, Frodo was going to walk out. Of course, he was just acting under the ring's influence, but it doesn't change the fact that he didn't destroy it-despite everyone's insistence that he was the only one who could.\r\n6 Breaking The Fellowship Didn't Necessarily Help\r\n\r\nAt the end of The Fellowship Of The Ring, Frodo breaks off from the Fellowship of people who have sworn to aid him in his quest to destroy the ring. He has become convinced, partially from the remarks of people like the elvish Lady Of the Wood and Gandalf, that he is the only one who can complete the task and involving others is risking their lives and the mission.\r\n\r\nPart of this decision operates under the assumption that Frodo is the only one who will not be overtaken by the ring. But the rest of the series goes to show that if Frodo were alone, he would have died many times over...and if he had more protection, or a horse, he would have gotten there faster.\r\n5 Sam Isn't Properly Celebrated\r\n\r\nAs soon as surrounding people realize that the ring has been destroyed, everyone immediately yells Frodo's name in celebration of him. Meanwhile, Sam did much of the grunt work of the mission, soberly convincing Frodo to keep going, looking out for his best interest, getting up before him every day and rationing food, and CARRYING HIM UP MOUNT DOOOM.\r\n\r\nOnce people see that Mount Doom has erupted, they call out-you guessed it-Frodo's name in anguish. After the eagles rescue Sam and Frodo, cut to a scene of all of Sam and Frodo's friends happily reuniting with Frodo in a slow-motion, glowy moment. Sam walks in after, hardly noticed.\r\n4 Gandalf Should've Been Able To Kill The Witch-King\r\n\r\nIt is stated that \"no man\" can kill the Witch-King. It's found later this rule is to be taken literally, as the people who kill the Witch-King are Merry, the hobbit, and Eowyn, the woman. Therefore, when Gandalf tried to kill him, not much reason is given to the fact that he can't. Gandalf is not of the race of men, he is a wizard. He also managed to kill the enormously powerfully balrog as the lesser-powerful Gandalf the Grey. Therefore, Gandalf the White should surely be able to kill the Witch-King.\r\n3 Sam and Frodo Didn't Need To Walk All That Way\r\n\r\nSam and Frodo walk a long, long way on foot. There are repeated shots of their bloody, bruised feet. It's understood they must keep off of the road with the ring-but couldn't they use horses for much of their trek? Mordor is right next door to Gondor, which we see Aragorn travel to by horse in a jiffy. All characters are seen to travel immense distances by horse in several instances, all in the time that Sam and Frodo are just trying to get from one place to another. Obviously, it would shorten the film if it was made so simple-but some reason to validate their need to walk by foot would be helpful.\r\n2 There Are Only Three Female Leads\r\n\r\nThis is a very obvious fact: there are only three female leads in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Yet somehow, it seems immensely shocking. If you are someone who has been watching the series or reading the books since a young age, it may have become something you took for granted and hardly even thought of since returning to the texts of either. Coming back to such creations that we hold so dear can be jolting. Wait, this is pretty much all....men. All men. Thankfully, the females included are pretty fierce forces to reckon with. But we grow so used to being flooded with male characters that it is important to stop and take note of who isn't on screen, and how easy it is to miss something so obvious.\r\n1 Frodo Left The Shire For Sam\r\n\r\nIn his final note to Samwise Gamgee, which he leaves to Sam at the time he departs from the Shire for good, Frodo states that Sam cannot be \"torn in two\" forever. Although slightly ambiguously stated, there is little that this statement could refer to aside from Frodo and Sam's relationship. Sam is now married, but knowing his devotion to Frodo he will always be concerned with him. We are made aware that Frodo has not assimilated back into Shire life well, expressing his belief that after such travels one cannot always pick up the \"threads\" of an old life again. Rather than stay and allow Sam to continue caring for him forever, Frodo leaves, creating the space for Sam to focus on his family and to write a chapter that is just for him.",

      "title": "Interstellar: Every Major Performance, Ranked",
      "description": "Christopher Nolan's 2014 sci-fi epic Interstellar features a superb cast of Hollywood actors led by Matthew McConaughey. But which star is the best?\r\n\r\nIt may not be as highly acclaimed or timeless as Christopher Nolan\u2019s all-time finest works, like Inception, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight trilogy, but 2014\u2019s Interstellar is one of the most thought-provoking and breathtakingly cinematic sci-fi epics in recent memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cast is anchored by Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a single father who becomes humanity\u2019s last hope when he\u2019s sent into deep space to find us a new home. But McConaughey is backed up by an impressive ensemble containing such huge talents as Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and Anne Hathaway. So, here are all the major performances in Interstellar, ranked.\r\n12 Matt Damon As Mann\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious marketing tricks pulled by Interstellar was leaving Matt Damon out of the trailers. No one knew that Damon was in Interstellar until they were actually watching the movie and he showed up.\r\n\r\nHis character, Dr. Mann, facilitates a twist as he turns out to be a villain who endangers the whole crew out of selfishness. But the twist is undermined by the fact that it\u2019s Matt Damon. His presence is distracting because it\u2019s unexpected, and also simply unusual.\r\n11 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet As Young Tom\r\n\r\nIn the couple of years that followed Interstellar, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet would become one of the world\u2019s most popular young movie stars with roles in Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird, and Beautiful Boy.\r\n\r\nBut while Christopher Nolan clearly saw something in the kid to cast him, he didn\u2019t give Chalamet a lot to do. Cooper clearly favors his daughter Murph over his son Tom, and as a result, Chalamet doesn\u2019t get a chance to shine.\r\n10 Anne Hathaway As Amelia Brand\r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway isn\u2019t given a lot of character work to do in Interstellar. She doesn\u2019t really play a character at all; instead, she\u2019s a mouthpiece for various heady monologues straight out of the mind of Christopher Nolan, like her long, winding musing on love being the only thing we can\u2019t measure mathematically.\r\n\r\nHathaway does what she can with the role, but she has far less to do here than she did in her previous collaboration with Nolan, The Dark Knight Rises.\r\n9 Wes Bentley As Doyle\r\n\r\nAlthough he has yet to top his breakout performance in American Beauty, Wes Bentley does an admirable job in the role of Doyle.\r\n\r\nLike most of the crew members working with Cooper, Doyle is required for drawn-out scientific explanations, but Bentley does a fine job in each scene.\r\n8 Ellen Burstyn As Old Murph\r\n\r\nEllen Burstyn only appears briefly in Interstellar, at the end of the movie when Cooper has returned to humanity and they\u2019re set up in a giant space station.\r\n\r\nBurstyn plays an elderly Murph, who has a sprawling family of her own when she\u2019s reunited with her dad \u2014 who, thanks to the laws of science fiction, is now half her age \u2014 and she plays the reunion as a really heartfelt moment with Matthew McConaughey.\r\n7 Bill Irwin As TARS\r\n\r\nBill Irwin provided the voice and puppetry for TARS, the A.I. featured in Interstellar. Rather than creating the crew\u2019s robot with CGI, Christopher Nolan wanted to use practical effects.\r\n\r\nAlthough TARS is essentially four metal pillars crawling around without a discernible face or any human features, Irwin\u2019s performance imbues the character with a distinctive personality.\r\n6 Casey Affleck As Adult Tom\r\n\r\nMurph still takes precedence over Tom in the later scenes of the movie, but Casey Affleck is given more to do than his younger counterpart, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\r\n\r\nViewers see a glimpse of the raw emotion that would win Affleck an Oscar a couple of years later for his heartbreaking turn in Manchester by the Sea.\r\n5 Mackenzie Foy As Young Murph\r\nInterstellar Movie Coop and Murph\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not easy for a child actor to hold their own opposite an A-list movie star, but Mackenzie Foy managed it in her scenes with Matthew McConaughey. The first section of Interstellar sets it up as a father-daughter story, but that focus slowly fades as Cooper jets off into space.\r\n\r\nStill, Foy\u2019s performance as a young Murph is pretty brilliant, establishing her arc that then continues with Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn.\r\n4 John Lithgow As Donald\r\n\r\nCooper\u2019s father-in-law Donald is the closest thing he has to a mentor. In this classical sci-fi tale, Donald fills the Ben Kenobi role, and John Lithgow is well-suited to that part.\r\n\r\nLithgow plays Donald\u2019s slowly deteriorating mind with tear-jerking poignancy. Although he only appears in the movie\u2019s early scenes, he leaves a lasting impression.\r\n3 Michael Caine As Professor Brand\r\n\r\nAs with all of his collaborations with Christopher Nolan, Michael Caine\u2019s role in Interstellar required him to deliver several teary-eyed monologues. Nolan knows how to gear a role towards Caine\u2019s strengths as a dramatic actor.\r\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t have as many comedic one-liners in Interstellar as he had when he played Alfred, but he has even more emotional scenes, and as one of the greats, Caine nails every single one.\r\n2 Jessica Chastain As Adult Murph\r\nJessica Chastain in Interstellar\r\n\r\nAs Murph grows up to become a scientist on the brink of saving humanity and bringing her father home, the duties of playing her are transferred to Jessica Chastain. As always, Chastain\u2019s performance is exquisite, playing on all the emotions that one would go through in the extraordinary circumstances faced by her character.\r\n\r\nWhen she stops hearing from her dad, she starts to resent him. And even though we know he was caught in an accelerated timeline on a distant planet and that\u2019s why he lost touch, we get why she\u2019d be so mad \u2014 especially when she reaches the age that he was when he left.\r\n1 Matthew McConaughey As Cooper\r\nMatthew McConaughey is Cooper in Interstellar\r\n\r\nAt the height of the McConaissance, Matthew McConaughey provided a powerful performance in the lead role of Interstellar. Cooper is one of the last remaining farmers in an increasingly barren America, and McConaughey\u2019s charm sure makes you root for him from the offset.\r\n\r\nWhether he\u2019s sobbing through decades\u2019 worth of video messages from his kids that he missed while he was on a planet where time passes much quicker or making humankind\u2019s first leap into a black hole, McConaughey\u2019s performance makes Cooper a compelling protagonist.",

      "title": "10 Best Batman Movies According To IMDb",
      "description": "Batman movies are often a huge success. Whether it's live-action or animated, we've been treated to some great ones featuring the Caped Crusader.\r\n\r\nFew comic-book characters have had as big of an impact on the film industry as Batman. Throughout the years, there have been many movies made about the hero. Some have been huge blockbusters, whereas others have been direct-to-video animated adventures.\r\n\r\nThe movies have varied in quality over the years. Nevertheless, some amazing Batman stories have been told through the medium of film. Every Dark Knight fan has their favorites, but we have used IMDb to rank the ten best.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that we have not included shorts, team-up movies (including The Lego Batman Movie) or animated home releases that have the word 'movie' in the title but are actually just a collection of episodes.\r\n10 Batman: Assault On Arkham - 7.5\r\n\r\nSet in the Arkham games' universe, this film follows Batman as he attempts to find a dirty bomb planted by The Joker. Meanwhile, Amanda Weller orders The Suicide Squad to break into Arkham Asylum to steal important information.\r\n\r\nWhile this is technically a Batman movie, he doesn't get as much screen time as The Suicide Squad. Although, the humorous interactions between the task force make up for the Dark Knight's reduced role. Plus, the fight scenes are violent and fun, whether they involve Batman, the Suicide Squad, or both.\r\n9 Batman (1989) - 7.5\r\n\r\nTim Burton's first Batman movie sees the Dark Knight go up against The Joker early in the hero's crime-fighting career. Michael Keaton gives a strong performance as the title character, yet it's still slightly overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's amazing version of The Joker. Nicholson's outrageous antics as the evil clown are some of the film's best moments, as the actor strikes the perfect balance of eccentric and menacing.\r\n\r\nAlong with excellent performances from its leads, the film has an abundance of style and a dark tone that suits the caped crusader (even if it was unique for a Batman film at the time).\r\n8 Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker - 7.8\r\n\r\nMark Hamill's Joker was always one of the best parts of the Batman: Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, so his return in this movie based on the Batman Beyond series was a welcome one. In the film, Joker's re-emergence raises questions as the original clown prince is thought to be dead. Young Batman then starts an investigation to find out who the new Joker is and put a stop to his plans.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is compelling throughout, particularly late on when you get to see how the dynamic between Terry McGinnis' Batman and The Joker differs from the one the clown shared with Bruce Wayne.\r\n7 Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm - 7.8\r\nBatman in Mask of the Phantasm\r\n\r\nBased on Batman: The Animated Series, Kevin Conroy, once again, provides the voice of the caped crusader as he is blamed for the murders of various mob bosses in Batman's first animated theatrical release. The film includes a compelling mystery as Batman slowly figures out the identity of the deadly vigilante.\r\n\r\nEqually intriguing are the multiple flashbacks throughout, which give extra insight into Bruce Wayne's life before he put on the cowl. It is a dark, stylish, and very well animated adventure that lives up to the standards of the TV series.\r\n6 Batman: Under The Red Hood - 8.0\r\n\r\nUnder The Red Hood is another film about a violent vigilante, as the Red Hood starts terrorizing the criminals in Gotham. The movie is incredibly emotional due to Batman's history with the man under the hood. And through the new vigilante, the film asks interesting questions about the morality of Batman's no-killing rule.\r\n\r\nAlongside its great storytelling, Under The Red Hood includes slick and exciting action sequences. Plus, the voice work is solid from all of the cast, but Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood is the stand-out performance.\r\n5 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 - 8.0\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight Returns movie adaptation is split into two parts. Part one focuses on a middle-aged Batman coming out of retirement when Gotham becomes overrun with crime.\r\n\r\nMany films have told the story of Batman first becoming a crime fighter, so this movie's depiction of an aged vigilante trying to overcome his body's natural deterioration is a nice change of pace. And Peter Weller does well to bring the veteran hero to life with his grizzled tones. The strong narrative is complemented by a beautiful art style and awesome animation.\r\n4 Batman Begins - 8.2\r\n\r\nBatman Begins gets Christopher Nolan's outstanding Dark Knight trilogy off to a strong start with its masterful retelling of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Set in a dark and grounded version of the Batman universe, the film relies more on excellent characters than large scale battles.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Christian Bale does a great job of displaying both the charisma of Bruce Wayne and the intensity of Batman. Similarly amazing is Cillian Murphy's villainous Scarecrow, as he delivers a haunting performance. Although, both actors are aided by some stellar writing.\r\n3 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 - 8.4\r\n\r\nIn The Dark Knight Returns Part 2, the aging Batman becomes a target for The Joker, the Gotham Police department, and the Government who have Superman at their disposal. This is the highest-rated animated movie on this list. And it shares many of the same qualities as part one.\r\n\r\nHowever, the addition of The Joker and Superman enhances the movie above its predecessor. This is because Batman's confrontations with both men are extremely exciting. In particular, it's interesting to see how an experienced (and slightly broken down) Dark Knight deals with the crazy clown.\r\n2 The Dark Knight Rises - 8.4\r\nChristian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan's third Batman movie sees the hero come out of retirement to stop the ruthless Bane, who is causing chaos all over Gotham. Bane's rampage involves some fantastic set-pieces, most of which include clever practical effects. And his fights with Batman are the most hard-hitting in the trilogy.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy is incredibly intimidating as the villain with his physical attributes making up for his sometimes questionable mask-assisted speaking voice. Another newcomer to the trilogy is Anne Hathaway, who delivers a badass version of Catwomen.\r\n1 The Dark Knight - 9.0\r\nHeath Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight\r\n\r\nThe second entry in Christopher Nolan's trilogy is not only regarded as the best Batman movie ever, but it is also seen as one of the greatest comic-book films ever. It tells the tale of an established Batman coming up against a new menace in the form of The Joker, who is intent on causing complete anarchy throughout Gotham.\r\n\r\nThe film has the same dark tone, grounded storytelling, and impressive practical effects of the other films in Nolan's trilogy. But it is the captivating performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker that raises it above its predecessor and sequel. From his crazy mannerisms that really sell the insanity of the character to his wonderfully delivered dialogue, the actor manages to capture the spirit of the maniacal clown.",

      "title": "Catch Me If You Can: Frank Abagnale's 10 Best Scams, Ranked",
      "description": "Catch Me If You Can tells the story of Frank Abagnale's life as a con man. These are the best and wildest scams that he pulled off.\r\n\r\nCatch Me If You Can is a wildly entertaining story and one of Steven Spielberg's most underrated films. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio in the real-life story of Frank Abagnale, a young man who, before he turned 20, mad become one of the most successful con men in American history.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into Frank's exploits and offers a fun and exciting adventure as he takes daring risks and lives lavishly while trying to remain one step ahead of the lawmen who are on his trail. These cons would seem too outlandish if you didn't know that many of them actually happened. Here are Frank Abagnale's best scams from Catch Me If You Can.\r\n10 The French Teacher\r\n\r\nThough Frank didn't embrace his conman ways until running away from home, it was clear that he always had a bit of a mischievous nature to him. After his family falls on hard times, Frank is taken out of private school and placed in public school. On his very first day, he already finds himself getting in trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter getting bullied by one of his new classmates, Frank decides to pose as the new French teacher to humiliate the bully. The scheme goes on surprisingly long as frank manages to keep it up for weeks and even begins planning a field trip before getting caught.\r\n9 Learning The Ropes\r\nCatch Me If You Can - Best Leonardo Dicaprio Performances\r\n\r\nUnlike some movie conmen, Frank does not take a relaxed approach to his crimes. He puts in the work and does the research necessary. So when he sets his sights on the airline companies as a potential opportunity to make some money, he decides he needs to learn as much information as possible.\r\n\r\nTo do this without arousing suspicion, Frank poses as a high school student writing a newspaper article on how to become a pilot. He gets incredible access to the process, the jargon and is even given I.D. badges that he later uses to forge his own.\r\n8 Frank Meets Carl\r\n\r\nAs Frank is hard at work on his criminal life, another man is hard at work tracking him down. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is a dedicated FBI agent who gets on Frank's trail early on when his criminal activity really takes off.\r\n\r\nCarl is effective enough to track Frank to a hotel room and corners him. However, Frank is quick on his feet and pretends to be a young Secret Service agent who is also hunting down this mystery forger. He bluffs his way through the situation, even giving Carl his wallet so he can check his credentials. Carl inadvertently just lets him walk away.\r\n7 Becoming A Pilot\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me if you Can\r\n\r\nThroughout Frank's criminal career, he seems to gravitate towards people in positions of power. When he is down on his luck, he spots a Pan Am pilot who is getting attention from everyone around him and decides that is the new path for himself.\r\n\r\nFrank studies how pilots walk and talk to come off as believable as possible. He even gets himself a genuine Pan Am uniform and has the bill sent to Pan Am to pay for it. As soon as he looks the part, everyone starts treating him differently and no one questions him.\r\n6 Hitching A Ride\r\n\r\nWhile posing as a pilot was initially a way of opening new doors for himself, Frank finds himself taking to the role quite well. He likes the attention he gets, especially from women and takes advantage of the perks of the position.\r\n\r\nOne such perk is hitching a ride for free on one of Pan Am's planes. It takes a lot of guts to pretend to be a pilot while sitting in a cockpit with real pilots, but if there's one thing Frank has, it's guts. However, he still can't fully hide that he has a slight fear of flying.\r\n5 Becoming A Lawyer\r\n\r\nIf being a pilot wasn't enough, Frank decided to pursue yet another enticing career by becoming a lawyer. However, unlike some of his other false identities, Frank did not do this to make money or get attention. Instead, he did it for love.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank falls for a young woman named Brenda (Amy Adams), he tries to get in good graces with her conservative Southern family by following her father's footsteps in becoming a lawyer. Impressively, Frank maintains that he didn't scam his way into passing the bar exam but rather did it honestly. However, his one time in court proves he might be a little overzealous about the position.\r\n4 A Pricy Date\r\n\r\nMuch like his hero James Bond, Frank uses his life of luxury to meet beautiful women who seem to take an interest in him as well. On one particular occasion, he meets a high priced escort named Cheryl (Jennifer Garner) who assumes he's a man of wealth and invites him on a date.\r\n\r\nAfter some flirting, Frank agrees to pay her $1000 for a night with her. However, when he plans to go cash a $1400 check to make the payment, she suggests he endorse the check to her, and she pays him the difference. In the end, their night together proved profitable for both of them.\r\n3 Stylish Getaway\r\n\r\nWhen Frank tries to settle down and start a real life with Brenda, Carl and the authorities begin closing in on him. After narrowly missing getting arrested at his own engagement party, Frank finds that the FBI is monitoring the airport to prevent him from making a getaway.\r\n\r\nHowever, Frank once again proves he has more guts than anyone when planning his escape. He once again poses as a Pan Am pilot and recruits a dozen beautiful women to become part of the Pan Am flight attendants' program. Frank shows up at the airport with all the ladies and suddenly no one is looking at the guy in the pilot's uniform.\r\n2 Becoming A Doctor\r\n\r\nPosing as a pilot and a lawyer is crazy enough, but for Frank to then think he can pull off posing as a doctor as well might suggest he's too crazy for his own good. On the other hand, he pulls it off.\r\n\r\nFrank decides to become a fake doctor almost on a whim after meeting Brenda who is working as a nurse. He learns the jargon and gets a sense of the job only by watching movies. When he is brought into the actual emergency room, it becomes clear that he is in way over his head.\r\n1 The Fake Checks\r\n\r\nFrank's real criminal activity starts a bit out of desperation. After running from home, Frank only has a checkbook for a bank account that has no money in it. As a way of getting some quick money, he begins forging checks. While no bank is willing to cash them, this begins his very profitable career as a forger.\r\n\r\nLike many of his other endeavors, Frank is meticulous and dedicated to making the check look authentic and eventually can steal millions of dollars with his various forging scams.",
