The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan and went on to do a following World War II production The Pacific. The episodes first started airing on HBO September 9, 2001. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe awards in 2001 for best miniseries.\r\n\r\nThe series dramatizes the history of \"Easy\" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 101st Airborne Division, from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, up until Japan's capitulation and the end of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to several episodes, with the men's real identities revealed in the finale.\r\n\r\nThe title for the book and series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series finale.",

      "description": "Brad Pitt Wins Best Supporting Actor Oscar\r\nIt's Pitt's first Academy Award in an acting category. He previously won as producer of \"12 Years a Slave.\"\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt has won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance as stunt double Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a fairly competitive category, Pitt beat out fellow nominees Tom Hanks (Fred Rogers in \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d), Anthony Hopkins (Pope Benedict XVI in \u201cThe Two Popes\u201d), Al Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa in \u201cThe Irishman\u201d), and Joe Pesci (Russell Bufalino in \u201cThe Irishman\u201d).\r\n\r\nThis is Pitt\u2019s fourth nomination as an actor, and his first acting Oscar win. Previously, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1996 for \u201c12 Monkeys,\u201d for Best Actor in 2009 for \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d for Best Actor in 2012 for \u201cMoneyball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a producer, he has three Best Picture nominations: \u201cMoneyball\u201d (2012), \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d (2014), and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d (2016). He won for \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d which was his first ever Oscar win.\r\n\r\nPitt already won both the Golden Globe and the SAG award in the Best Supporting Actor category, and was fully expected to win the Oscar as well.\r\n\r\nIndieWire awards editor Anne Thompson predicted that Pitt would win the category, with Anthony Hopkins (\u201cThe Two Popes\u201d) potentially playing spoiler. Her bottom line: \u201cNobody can possibly catch up with Pitt\u2019s performance as moccasin-wearing zen stuntman Cliff Booth, nor his awards circuit charm offensive (including witty, self-deprecating speeches \u2014 his ghost writer earned their fee \u2014 and hand-holding with his ex, Jennifer Aniston). While \u2018The Two Popes\u2019 is an unsung actor-fest that many voters love, Oscar voters want this key win for \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d received a total of 10 nominations. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2019, and was theatrically released in the U.S. on July 26, 2019.\r\n\r\nThe film has grossed $374 million worldwide and received universal praise from critics for Tarantino\u2019s screenplay and direction, acting, cinematography, costume design, production values, and soundtrack.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, during the final moments of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), former star of a 1950s western TV series, and his longtime stunt double and easygoing best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don\u2019t recognize anymore. But Rick has very famous next-door neighbors: Roman Polanski (Rafa\u0142 Zawierucha) and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) \u2014 the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.\r\n\r\nAs with any Tarantino film, the reception for \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d wasn\u2019t without controversy. Although its context is a possibly-skewed memory of Cliff Booth\u2019s, and not a \u201creal\u201d event in the narrative, the film\u2019s portrayal of Bruce Lee drew much criticism from fans, contemporaries and Lee\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a key fight sequence involving Pitt\u2019s character and Lee was the subject of much contention. In the scene, Lee challenges Cliff to a three-round fight on the set of \u201cThe Green Hornet\u201d after Cliff insults him. Lee wins the first round by knocking Cliff off his feet. Cliff wins round two by launching Lee into the side of a car. But just as the final round is to begin, a \u201cGreen Hornet\u201d stunt coordinator, played by Zo\u00eb Bell, arrives on set to puts an end to the contest, effectively calling the match a tie.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to stunt coordinator Robert Alonzo, the sequence was supposed to be much longer, with Cliff definitely beating Lee. But Pitt wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea of Lee losing the fight, and (along with Alonzo, who considers Lee a personal hero) petitioned Tarantino to alter the script, which he of course did.\r\n\r\nBut of Lee\u2019s general portrayal, daughter, Shannon, said this: \u201c[Bruce Lee] was continuously marginalized and treated like kind of a nuisance of a human being by white Hollywood, which is how he\u2019s treated in the film.\u201d\r\n\r\nTarantino responded to the criticism, saying Lee was \u201ckind of an arrogant guy\u201d, and that Lee\u2019s widow, Linda Lee Cadwell, wrote in her 1975 book \u201cBruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew,\u201d that he could beat Muhammad Ali. But Cadwell was actually quoting a TV critic. In 1972, Lee himself said: \u201cEverybody says I must fight Ali someday \u2026 Look at my hand. That\u2019s a little Chinese hand. He\u2019d kill me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d features a large ensemble cast led by DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, and Al Pacino.\r\n\r\nIt is the last film to feature Luke Perry, who died in March 2019.\r\n\r\nProduced by Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain \u2014 their first involvement with the Oscars \u2014 the 92nd Academy Awards were held on Sunday, February 9, 2020, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center, in Hollywood, and was televised live on ABC. The Oscars are also televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.",

      "title": "Bong Joon Ho Defeats Sam Mendes to Win Best Director Oscar in Nail-Biting Race",
      "description": "Bong's unprecedented win is the latest in a history-making night for South Korea's \"Parasite.\"\r\n\r\nEnding a nail-biting derby pitting Bong Joon Ho against Sam Mendes for Best Director, the South Korean filmmaker took home the Academy Award on Sunday night for his direction on \u201cParasite.\u201d While all signs throughout awards season had pointed to Mendes taking home the gold \u2014 including wins from the EE BAFTAs, the Directors Guild of America, and the Golden Globes \u2014 the love for \u201cParasite\u201d overpowered the \u201c1917\u201d narrative. Bong\u2019s win for Best Director adds to an already unprecedented set of wins for the film \u2014 three in total \u2014 which include Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature. These are all firsts for a Korean-language film.\r\n\r\nAlong with \u201c1917\u201d filmmaker Mendes, Bong also beat out Todd Phillips for \u201cJoker,\u201d Martin Scorsese for \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d All of those films are up for Best Picture as well, but that race at this point is between \u201c1917\u201d and \u201cParasite,\u201d barring a last-minute upset.\r\n\r\n\u201cParasite\u201d has been the darling of critics and audiences since it won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival back in May 2019 \u2014 also the first South Korean film ever to do so. Neon opened the film in October, and the film has already grossed $33 million in the United States and counting. Around the world, the film\u2019s box-office total exceeds $165 million, and as the movie is still in theaters (and also now available to stream), that number is only going to climb. After Oscar wins and record box office, though, the movie\u2019s legacy doesn\u2019t end here, as it was announced recently that Bong and Adam McKay will partner with HBO to adapt the film into a limited series. Plans are set to begin taking shape in March on what that series will look like.\r\n\r\nThe awards season haul for \u201cParasite\u201d has heretofore included more than 200 wins, including: the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture in a Foreign Language, the EE BAFTA Awards for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the Broadcast Film Critics Choice Awards for Best Director (tied with Sam Mendes for \u201c1917\u201d) and Best Foreign Language Film, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Film, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Song Kang-ho), and many, many more.\r\n\r\nBong Joon Ho\u2019s prior credits include arthouse favorites \u201cOkja,\u201d \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d \u201cThe Host,\u201d \u201cMemories of Murder,\u201d and \u201cBarking Dogs Never Bite.\u201d With \u201cParasite\u201d awards-season chores now out of the way, he will turn his attention to the HBO version of the film. It remains to be seen whether the next iteration of \u201cParasite\u201d will unfold in English or Korean, but Bong recently did offer a tease of his thoughts on what\u2019s to come for the limited series adaptation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really liked Adam McKay\u2019s \u2018The Big Short\u2019 and I loved his sense of humor, and the sharp satire he conveyed about the current American politics,\u201d Bong said of his creative partner on the series. \u201cWith \u2018Parasite,\u2019 while I was writing the script I had so many more ideas I couldn\u2019t convey into the two-hour running time of the film. I knew that if I had a longer running time, I would be able to tell these stories, and I that\u2019s what I plan to talk about with Adam pretty soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThough I\u2019m not very familiar with the TV industry, I really consider this limited series an expanded film that can delve deeper into the stories that didn\u2019t make it into \u2018Parasite.\u2019 Adam McKay and HBO have created the amazing show \u2018Succession,\u2019 so they\u2019re very reliable and amazing partners to have,\u201d Bong said. He also cited Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1982 miniseries \u201cFanny and Alexander\u201d as a potential influence.\r\n\r\nDespite his success on the heels of \u201cParasite,\u201d however, Bong Joon Ho told IndieWire he has no plans to sell out and direct a tentpole or, say, foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \u201cI received a lot of [Hollywood] offers after \u2018The Host\u2019 in 2006,\u201d Bong said. \u201cLots of science-fiction, horror, and action films. I was just like, \u2018Wow, a Hollywood script!\u2019 I didn\u2019t accept any of them. My agent is a very nice guy and they already know that I like to direct my own scripts like Quentin Tarantino. Sometimes I do get a little disappointed that he doesn\u2019t send me anything. He doesn\u2019t send me any scripts now knowing that I always write my own.\u201d\r\n\r\nFollow all of IndieWire\u2019s 2020 Academy Awards coverage here, and see the full list of tonight\u2019s winners here.",

      "description": "Quentin Tarantino celebrates his 57th birthday on March 27, 2020. The Oscar-winning writer-director redefined independent cinema with his pulpy mix of violence, dark humor and pop culture, crafting several modern classics. In honor of his birthday, let\u2019s take a look back at all 10 of his films, ranked worst to best.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1963, Tarantino made a living as a video store clerk while penning spec scripts. He made his directorial debut with \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d (1992), a \u201cRashomon\u201d-esque crime drama about a botched jewel heist. Two more of his scripts, \u201cTrue Romance\u201d (1993) and \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d (1994), were later produced by Tony Scott and Oliver Stone, respectively.\r\n\r\nHe hit the Oscar jackpot just two years after his filmmaking debut with \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994), a multi-narrative, self-referential pastiche about a group of criminals whose lives intersect in surprising ways. After winning the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, the indie hit went on to collect a screenwriting prize for Tarantino and Roger Avery, earning nominations in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (John Travolta), Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman) and Best Film Editing. A slew of imitators followed, none matching the original\u2019s blend of carnage, comedy, and pop culture.\r\n\r\nTarantino returned to the Oscar race with his World War II epic \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (2009), which brought him nominations for writing and directing. He collected his second trophy in Best Original Screenplay three years later for \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), a spaghetti western homage about a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) searching for his wife in the Civil War-era South. Both films competed in Best Picture, and both reaped Best Supporting Actor victories for Christoph Waltz.\r\n\r\nHe wracked up three more nominations for his latest outing, the 2019 release, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d A loving tribute to the movies, music and television of 1969 Los Angeles, the film personally brought him 2020 bids for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay (plus ones for stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, who won the Best Supporting Actor prize).",

      "title": "Baz Luhrmann Confirms Halting of \u2018Elvis\u2019 Project With Tom Hanks",
      "description": "Australian director Baz Luhrmann says that now is not the moment to be resuming production on his untitled \u201cElvis\u201d project. The film was halted since last week, when actor Tom Hanks was diagnosed with the corovavirus.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet on Friday afternoon Luhrmann said: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will come as no surprise that this is not the moment to be resuming production on the film. Please know that this is in now way a reflection our commitment to making the movie here in Queensland. In fact we are not even taking our sets down, simply locking up the creative space over the next few days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spoken to the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, and we all agree that right now, this is the time for people all over the world, from all walks of life, to be at home indoors, with their loved ones (washing our hands five time a day). All going well we have a passionate conviction to be back here on the Gold Coast, picking up where we left off as soon as the time is right. Baz.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen that could possibly be was thrown into further doubt when Australia announced that it was effectively sealing its borders to all foreigners who are not permanent residents. The move takes affect from 9pm Friday. The country has more than 700 confirmed coronavirus cases, with the significant majority imported with returning travelers, or people in close contact with them.\r\n\r\nBacked by Warner Bros., the film in advanced pre-production, with shooting set to have begun next week. Austin Butler is to play Presley, Maggie Gyllenhaal the star\u2019s mother Gladys. Hanks is to play Col. Tom Parker, Presley\u2019s all-controlling manager.\r\n\r\nLuhrmann co-wrote the script with Craig Pearce. The movie covers the relationship between the veteran manager and the young singer, who came from dirt-poor origins to become an iconic star who changed the course of music. The project marks Luhrmann\u2019s first film since his adaptation of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio. He most recently worked on the Netflix series \u201cThe Get Down.\u201d\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Presley talked about his devotion to his mother, constantly calling her his number one girl. The close relationship is said to have continued when the musician\u2019s career took off and during Gladys\u2019 bout of depression due to his time away from home.\r\n\r\nThe production was expected to employ 900 Queenslanders in behind-the-scenes roles, including set construction, catering and transportation, and inject more than $105 million into the local economy, Palaszczuk announced last May when it was announced that Queensland and the Village Roadshow Studios, on the Gold Coast, had secured the film to shoot in the territory.\r\n\r\nHanks revealed on March 12 that he and his wife Rita had tested positive for the coronavirus. They were admitted to hospital and have since been released into self-isolation in an apartment. On Wednesday Hanks tweeted that the pair remain stable and cheerful, living a quarantine period playing cards, doing the laundry and working a Corona typewriter.",

      "bio": "Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film.\r\n\r\nHe began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, which was funded by money from the sale of his script True Romance. Empire deemed Reservoir Dogs the \"Greatest Independent Film of All Time\". His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a comedy crime film, was a major success both among critics and audiences. He also wrote the screenplay for and starred in the vampire film From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Tarantino paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.\r\n\r\nKill Bill, a highly stylized \"revenge flick\" in the cinematic traditions of kung fu films, Japanese martial arts, and spaghetti westerns, followed six years later, and was released as two films: Volume 1 in 2003 and Volume 2 in 2004. Tarantino next directed the exploitation slasher film Death Proof in 2007, as part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez, released in the tradition of grindhouse cinema of the 1970s under the collective title Grindhouse. His long-postponed Inglourious Basterds, which tells an alternate history of Nazi Germany, was released in 2009 to positive reviews. After that came critically acclaimed Django Unchained (2012), a western film set in the Antebellum South. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was released in its roadshow version in 70 mm film format, with opening \"overture\" and halfway-point intermission. His ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, an alternate history of the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders, was released in 2019.\r\n\r\nTarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success as well as a dedicated cult-following. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and five Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him \"the single most influential director of his generation\". In December 2015, Tarantino received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, he married Israeli model-actress-singer Daniella Pick with whom he had a son, Leo, in February 2020.",

He is well-regarded for his cultural influence on 20th-century film. Brando was an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and Method Acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.\r\n\r\nHe initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and an Academy Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James Michener's 1954 novel.\r\n\r\nThe 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972). He got the part, and subsequently won his second Academy Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris, Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\r\n\r\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles, such as in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.\r\n\r\nBrando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century. In this list, Time also designated Brando as the \"Actor of the Century\".",

      "bio": "Francis Ford Coppola (born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, film composer, and vintner. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.\r\n\r\nAfter directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo).\r\n\r\nThe Godfather Part II, which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. The Conversation, which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, Apocalypse Now (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\r\n\r\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), the crime dramas The Cotton Club (1984) and The Godfather Part III (1990), and the horror film Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress Talia Shire; his daughter Sofia Coppola and granddaughter Gia Coppola are directors, and the actors Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are his nephews. Coppola resides in Napa, California.",

      "bio": "Steven Allan Spielberg (born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. Spielberg started in Hollywood directing television and several minor theatrical releases. He became a household name as the director of Jaws (1975), which was critically and commercially successful and is considered the first summer blockbuster. His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction/adventure films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993), which became archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.\r\n\r\nSpielberg transitioned into addressing serious issues in his later work with The Color Purple (1985), Empire of the Sun (1987), Schindler's List (1993), Amistad (1997), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). He has largely adhered to this practice during the 21st century, with Munich (2005), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017).\r\n\r\nHe co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Studios, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for several successful film trilogies, tetralogies and more including the Gremlins, Back to the Future, Men in Black, and the Transformers series. He later transitioned into producing several video games.\r\n\r\nSpielberg is one of the American film industry's most critically successful filmmakers, with praise for his directing talent and versatility, and he has won the Academy Award for Best Director twice. Some of his movies are also among the highest-grossing films, while his total work makes him the highest-grossing film director in history. His net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion.",

He was the author of the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.\r\n\r\nHe served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis\u2014they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\r\n\r\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.\r\n\r\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes ranked him the fifth top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.",
